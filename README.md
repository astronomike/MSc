Main source code for MSc project 'Did Dark Matter Kill the Dinosaurs?'.

parameters.txt contains the necessary input values for various dark matter and halo properties. 
gamma_setup.py contains function calls and plotting functionality for most applications of the code.
dm_annihilation.py contains function definitions for all physics-based quantities, calculations involving gamma ray fluxes from dark matter annihilation/decay and calculations describing the mass-distribution of various DM sub-halos.
data_read.py & data_write.py include data manipulation tools for reading and writing spectra/results files.
